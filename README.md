 # Project 1: [Indian Food ML project](https://github.com/Mahnoormalik123/Indian-food-project)
Description:  In this project, I conducted a comprehensive data analysis and applied various machine learning techniques to a dataset of Indian foods. The project workflow included:

 â€¢ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : Performed data exploration, cleaning, and visualization to understand the data distribution and identify patterns and insights.
 â€¢ Data Visualization : Created informative visualizations using libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn to illustrate trends and relationships within the dataset.
 â€¢ Data Preprocessing : Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and scaled features to prepare the data for machine learning models.
 â€¢ Model Implementation : Applied multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes to predict and classify different aspects of Indian cuisine.
 â€¢ Model Evaluation : Assessed model performance using accuracy scores, classification reports, and other relevant metrics to determine the best-performing model.

This project showcased my proficiency in Python, data manipulation, EDA, visualization, and various machine learning techniques, demonstrating the practical application of data science in analyzing and understanding.
