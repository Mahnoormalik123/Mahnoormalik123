## 📈 Projects

### [Indian Food ML Project](https://github.com/Mahnoormalik123/Indian-food-project)
**Description**: In this project, I conducted a comprehensive data analysis and applied various machine learning techniques to a dataset of Indian foods. The project workflow included:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed data exploration, cleaning, and visualization to understand the data distribution and identify patterns and insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Created informative visualizations using libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn to illustrate trends and relationships within the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and scaled features to prepare the data for machine learning models.
- **Model Implementation**: Applied multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes to predict and classify different aspects of Indian cuisine.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using accuracy scores, classification reports, and other relevant metrics to determine the best-performing model.

This project showcased my proficiency in Python, data manipulation, EDA, visualization, and various machine learning techniques, demonstrating the practical application of data science in analyzing and understanding Indian cuisine.
